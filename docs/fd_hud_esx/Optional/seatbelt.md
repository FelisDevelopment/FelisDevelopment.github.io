### Seatbelt
If you want use our seatbelt solution, please be sure to disable other seatbelt resources, since it might overlap.
To enable built-in seatbelts just update config `Config.SeatbeltEnabled` to `true` and update your default key to toggle seatbelt.

### Additional configuration
If you're using our seatbelt, please add this to `server.cfg`, otherwise it won't work.

```
setr game_enableFlyThroughWindscreen true
```
