title: Reticle

## Original GTA Reticle
Since most of the servers use crosshair, we've added gfx, which removes hit markers, red dot, dead position indicators to original GTA reticle. If you want to use default crosshair, it'll perfectly fit your RP server and make it even harder to be a "clapper".

## Removal
If you don't want it, remove `hud_reticle.gfx` file from `stream` folder and restart your server.
